# COMMAND LINE FOR THE WIN

After completing all challenges. I used SFTP to transfter my screenshots to the sandbox
through this steps:

I connected my sandbox to my machine with the SFTP sandbox found on my ALX intranet.
Afterwards, I created the required directory with the help of SSH.

Later on, withing my SFTP, I used put command to transfer files from my local machine to the
created directory.

Then after uploading all images, I used SSH to push changes to my github.

That's all,
